# Futured KMP Template

Hey there üëã

This is our template from which we build Kotlin Multiplatform applications that target Android and iOS platforms.
It is our opinionated way of building KMP apps and shines a light on how we structure our architecture and what tools and libraries we use.

To give you a short overview of our stack, we use:

- Native UI on both platforms. Jetpack Compose on Android and SwiftUI on iOS. The rest of application is shared in KMP.
- [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose) for sharing presentation logic and navigation state.
- The app follows MVVM design pattern, ViewModels are built around Decompose InstanceKeeper feature.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) for dependency injection.
- [SKIE](https://skie.touchlab.co/) for better Kotlin->Swift interop (exhaustive enums, sealed classes, Coroutines support).
- [moko-resources](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-resources) for sharing string, color and image resources.
- [apollo-kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) client for apps which call GraphQL APIs.
- [ktorfit](https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit) client for apps which call plain HTTP APIs.
- [Jetpack DataStore](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/datastore) as a simple preferences storage (we have JSON-based and primitive implementations).

The template itself is a sample app with several screens to let you kick off the project with everything set up including navigation and some API calls.

~~[Project specific standard](www.notion.so)~~

## Gradle tasks

1. `clean` - Remove all `build` folders
2. `lintCheck` - Run `ktlint`, `detekt` checks. Same runs on CI.
3. `ktlintFormat` - Reformat source code according to ktlint rules.
4. `generateMRcommonMain` - Regenerate shared resource IDs. 
5. `:shared:network:graphql:downloadApolloSchemaFromIntrospection` - Download latest Apollo schema
6. `:shared:network:graphql:generateApolloSources` - Generate Apollo sources (rebuilds models after adding modifying queries, mutations, etc.)

## Navigation Structure

The app utilizes [Decompose](https://arkivanov.github.io/Decompose/) to share presentation logic and navigation state in KMP.  
The following meta-description provides an overview of Decompose navigation tree:

```kotlin
Navigation("RootNavigation") {
    Slot {
        Screen("LoginScreen")
        Navigation("HomeNavigation") {
            Stack {
                Screen("FirstScreen")
                Screen("SecondScreen")
                Screen("ThirdScreen")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Project Setup

### Initial script

Use `init_template.kts` script to setup the template. 
The script renames directories and package names in files to given package name.

It is written in Kotlin. In order to run it you need to have [kscript](https://github.com/kscripting/kscript) installed.
#### Usage
```shell
kscript init_template.kts
```

### Product Flavors

The project utilizes [BuildKonfig](https://github.com/yshrsmz/BuildKonfig) plugin for implementing build flavors in network module.
There are two product flavors: `dev` and `prod`, which select API url used in `:shared:network:rest` and `:shared:network:graphql` modules.

In general, the build flavor can be specified as a Gradle build flag
```shell
./gradlew whateverTask -P buildkonfig.flavor=dev
```

Please, refer to `:shared:network:*` module Gradle configs for more info.

#### Android

During local development, the build flavor can be specified in `gradle.properties` file like so:
```properties
buildkonfig.flavor=dev
```

#### iOS

On iOS, we utilize .xcconfig [Build Configuration](https://www.kodeco.com/21441177-building-your-app-using-build-configurations-and-xcconfig) files,
where each file per build configuration specifies a `KMP_FLAVOR` environment variable.

This variable is then used in shared framework build step to pass the flavor as Gradle build flag:
```shell
./gradlew :shared:app:embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode -P buildkonfig.flavor=$KMP_FLAVOR
```

Currently, the `Debug` build configuration uses `dev` flavor and `Release` configuration uses `prod` flavor.
When adding new build configurations, please make sure to also define the `KMP_FLAVOR` variable using the aforementioned method.

### Crashlytics

We can have symbolicated Kotlin crash reports on iOS.  We use [NSExceptionKt](https://github.com/rickclephas/NSExceptionKt) to achieve that.
Everything is set up, but some finishing touches need to be made when you add Crashlytics to your project:

1. Set up Firebase Crashlytics on both platforms as you would usually do.
2. After dependencies are in place, on each platform uncomment the code in `PlatformFirebaseCrashlyticsImpl` classes (follow comments).
3. On iOS, do not forget to also upload debug symbols from KMP framework. This has to be done manually. To do this, set up additional build phase in Xcode:

```shell
# https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-deobfuscated-reports?platform=ios&authuser=1#manually-upload-dsyms

# Location of GoogleService-Info.plist file for Firebase project (this might depend on build configuration)
GSPFILE="path_to_your_file.plist"

# `KOTLIN_FRAMEWORK_NAME` env variable should be defined in `.xcconfig` file for current build configuration.
# The other ones are implicitly provided by Xcode.
DSYMFILE="${SRCROOT}/../shared/app/build/xcode-frameworks/${CONFIGURATION}/${SDK_NAME}/${KOTLIN_FRAMEWORK_NAME}.framework.dSYM"

echo "Uploading Kotlin framework dSYM to Crashlytics"
echo "Google Services file: ${GSPFILE}"
echo "Shared framework dSYM file: ${DSYMFILE}"

# Validate
${BUILD_DIR%/Build/*}/SourcePackages/checkouts/firebase-ios-sdk/Crashlytics/upload-symbols --build-phase --validate -gsp ${GSPFILE} -p ios ${DSYMFILE}

# Upload
${BUILD_DIR%/Build/*}/SourcePackages/checkouts/firebase-ios-sdk/Crashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp ${GSPFILE} -p ios ${DSYMFILE}
```
