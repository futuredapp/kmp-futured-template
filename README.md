# Futured KMP Template

Hey there üëã

This is our template from which we build Kotlin Multiplatform applications that target Android and
iOS platforms.
It is our opinionated way of building KMP apps and shines a light on how we structure our
architecture and what tools and libraries we use.

To give you a short overview of our stack, we use:

- Native UI on both platforms. Jetpack Compose on Android and SwiftUI on iOS. The rest of the
  application is shared in KMP.
- [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose) for sharing presentation logic and navigation
  state.
- The presentation layer follows the MVI-like design pattern.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) for dependency injection.
- [SKIE](https://skie.touchlab.co/) for better Kotlin->Swift interop (exhaustive enums, sealed
  classes, Coroutines support).
- [moko-resources](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-resources) for sharing string (and other types
  of) resources.
- [apollo-kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) network client for apps that call
  GraphQL APIs.
- [ktorfit](https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit) network client for apps that call plain HTTP APIs.
- [Jetpack DataStore](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/datastore) as a simple
  preferences storage (we have JSON-based and primitive implementations).
- [iOS-templates](https://github.com/futuredapp/iOS-templates) as template which generates a new iOS
  scene using MVVM-C architecture.

The template is a sample app with several screens to let you kick off the project with everything
set up, incl. navigation and some API calls.

   Swift Package as dependency. (This task shouldn't be used directly, build the KMP target in
   Xcode, instead.)
5. `assembleAndCopyReleaseSwiftPackage` - Assemble release KMP XCFramework and copy it into local
   iOS Swift Package as dependency. (This task shouldn't be used directly, build the KMP target in
   Xcode, instead.)
6. `generateMRcommonMain` - Regenerate shared resource IDs.
7. `:shared:network:graphql:downloadApolloSchemaFromIntrospection` - Download the latest Apollo
   schema.
8. `:shared:network:graphql:generateApolloSources` - Generate Apollo sources (rebuilds models after
   adding modifying queries, mutations, etc.).

## Kotlin Multiplatform Swift Package Integration

### Architecture Overview

The iOS application integrates with KMP code through a local Swift Package Manager (SPM) package
located at `iosApp/shared/KMP/`. This package wraps the XCFramework generated by the KMP Gradle
plugin, providing a clean and modern dependency management approach.

Key components:

1. **Swift Package**: Located at `iosApp/shared/KMP/` with `Package.swift` defining the binary
   target
2. **XCFramework**: Generated by Gradle and referenced by the Swift Package
3. **Makefile**: Automates the build process based on environment variables
4. **Build Configuration**: Environment variables defined in `.xcconfig` files

### Environment Variables

Two critical environment variables control the build process:

- **`KMP_FRAMEWORK_BUILD_TYPE`**: Specifies the framework build type (`debug` or `release`)
    - Set in `.xcconfig` files for each Xcode build configuration
    - Controls optimization level and debug information
    - Determines which Gradle task to run (`assembleAndCopyDebugSwiftPackage` or
      `assembleAndCopyReleaseSwiftPackage`)

- **`KMP_BUILD_FLAVOR`**: Specifies the product flavor (see [Product Flavors](#product-flavors))
    - Set in `.xcconfig` files for each Xcode build configuration
    - Controls API endpoints and environment-specific configuration
    - Passed to Gradle as `-P buildkonfig.flavor=$(KMP_BUILD_FLAVOR)`

### Development Workflow

To build and update the KMP package during development:

1. **Select and build the "Build KMP" target in Xcode**:
    - This target's build phase runs the Makefile with the appropriate environment variables
    - The Makefile detects the build configuration and runs the corresponding Gradle task
    - The XCFramework is generated and copied to the Swift Package location

2. **Alternative manual build**:
    - `./gradlew assembleAndCopyDebugSwiftPackage`
    - or if you wish to specify product flavor (default is always `dev`):
      `./gradlew assembleAndCopyDebugSwiftPackage -P buildkonfig.flavor=[dev|prod]`

3. **After KMP code changes**:
    - Always rebuild the "KMP Package" target to update the XCFramework
    - Then build the main app target to use the updated KMP code

## Navigation Structure

The app utilizes [Decompose](https://arkivanov.github.io/Decompose/) to share presentation logic and
navigation state in KMP.  
The following meta-description provides an overview of Decompose navigation tree:

```kotlin
Navigation("RootNavHost") {
    Slot {
        Screen("LoginScreen")
        Navigation("SignedInNavHost") {
            // Bottom navigation stack
            Stack {
                // Home tab
                Navigation("HomeNavHost") {
                    Stack {
                        Screen("FirstScreen")
                        Screen("SecondScreen") {
                            Slot {
                                Screen("Picker")
                            }
                        }
                        Screen("ThirdScreen")
                    }
                }
                // Profile tab
                Navigation("ProfileNavHost") {
                    Stack {
                        Screen("ProfileScreen")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Project Setup

### Initial script

Use `init_template.kts` script to set up the template.
The script renames directories and package names in files to the given package name.

It is written in Kotlin. To run it you need to have [kscript](https://github.com/kscripting/kscript)
installed.

#### Usage

```shell
kscript init_template.kts
```

### Product Flavors

The project utilizes [BuildKonfig](https://github.com/yshrsmz/BuildKonfig) plugin for implementing
build flavors in the network module.
There are two product flavors: `dev` and `prod`, which select API url used in `:shared:network:rest`
and `:shared:network:graphql` modules.

In general, the build flavor can be specified as a Gradle build flag

```shell
./gradlew whateverTask -P buildkonfig.flavor=dev
```

Please, refer to `:shared:network:*` module Gradle configs for more info.

#### Android

During local development, the build flavor can be specified in `gradle.properties` file like so:

```properties
buildkonfig.flavor=dev
```

#### Charles Proxy

[Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/welcome/) is enabled for debug and
enterprise builds.

#### iOS

On iOS, we utilize
.xcconfig [Build Configuration](https://www.kodeco.com/21441177-building-your-app-using-build-configurations-and-xcconfig)
files,
where each file per build configuration specifies a `KMP_BUILD_FLAVOR` environment variable.

This variable is then used in the "Build KMP" target to pass the flavor as Gradle build
flag.

```shell
./gradlew assembleAndCopyDebugSwiftPackage -P buildkonfig.flavor=$(KMP_BUILD_FLAVOR)
```
See [Makefile](iosApp/shared/KMP/Makefile) for reference.

Currently, the `Debug.xcconfig` file sets `KMP_BUILD_FLAVOR=dev` and the `Release.xcconfig` sets
`KMP_BUILD_FLAVOR=prod`. When adding new build configurations, please make sure to also define the
`KMP_BUILD_FLAVOR`
variable using the aforementioned method.

### Crashlytics

We can have symbolicated Kotlin crash reports on iOS. We
use [NSExceptionKt](https://github.com/rickclephas/NSExceptionKt) to achieve that.
Everything is set up, but some finishing touches need to be made when you add Crashlytics to your
project:

1. Set up Firebase Crashlytics on both platforms as you would usually do.
2. After dependencies are in place, on each platform uncomment the code in
   `PlatformFirebaseCrashlyticsImpl` classes (follow comments).
3. On iOS, do not forget to also upload debug symbols to Crashlytics. The KMP framework is static,
   so no standalone debug symbols are generated for KMP, instead, they are included in the app
   itself.

## Deep Linking

Deep links are provided by each platform to common code and parsed using `DeepLinkResolver` class.
The (sample) app currently supports the following url scheme: `kmptemplate` and the following links:

- `kmptemplate://home` -- Opens Home tab with default stack.
- `kmptemplate://profile` -- Opens Profile tab with default stack.
- `kmptemplate://home/second` -- Opens SecondScreen in Home tab.
- `kmptemplate://home/third?arg={argument}` -- Opens ThirdScreen in Home tab with provided argument.
  The `argument` is mandatory.
- `kmptemplate://home/third/{argument}` -- Opens ThirdScreen in Home tab with provided argument. The
  `argument` is mandatory.
