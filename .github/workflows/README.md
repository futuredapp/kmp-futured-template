## Setting Up Workflows

Predefined workflows use shared configurations from the [Futured .github repository](https://github.com/futuredapp/.github).

### Adjusting Workflows
If you need modifications, such as adding new environment variables, consider the following approaches:

1. **Suggest Improvements to Shared Workflows**  
   If the change could benefit multiple projects, propose an update to the shared workflows.

2. **Customize for Your Project**  
   If the change is project-specific, copy the shared workflow into your repository and modify it accordingly.

### 2. Configure workflow .yml files

For each workflow configuration file, configure all environment variables marked with `TODO` comment.
